# Hilbert-for-Human-Science

Lockdown task: write the human-science equivalent of Hilbert's [23 questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_problems):

1. Can a program be written which when run is itself conscious?
  * The running program, not some product that *results* from the program having run (such as the brain) must be conscious.
  * Running the program in the human mind and double-dipping to claim your program is conscious, or similar gimmicks don't count. 
  * Definition of conscious: “what we have". This was a road block for Turing, who needed a test of whether an object was conscious. Here, we are wanting a proof.
2. Can a behavior be shown to result from an evolved module rather than a culture?
 * Tinbergen proposed “emerges under all cultures" is one such, rightly awarded a Nobel to Tinbergen, but requires testing all cultures.
3. Can a behavior be shown to be cultural rather than resulting from an invariant module?
4. Devise a formal test which shows a behavior is innate?

Thinking more towards proving rather than corroborating. For some an existence proof might be legitimate. For others, empiricism and induction.
